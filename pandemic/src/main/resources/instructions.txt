This is an evolutionary algorithm for solving the traveling
salesman problem.

Choose the number of cities you wish to solve for, specify the
parameters for the algorithm, and press "START".

The best solution of every generation is shown in the window
to the right. The current generation, fitness and total
population is displayed in the bottom bar. Low fitness implies
a better solution.

Choosing too high starting population, reproduction rate
and/or too low selection pressure will make the population
grow very fast, leading to slow performance and potential
crashes. A higher mutation rate will increase chances of
escaping local minima but will also risk ruining good solutions.
